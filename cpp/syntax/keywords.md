# keywords
Description and examples of keywords within C++

## default
Added to a function declaration to declare that a function is explicitly defaulted. Needs to be a special member function of the class. Using 'default' is a more efficient implementation than declaring an empty function {}.

**C++ 11 feature**
```
class foo {
  //constructor is generated by the compiler
  foo() = default;
};
```

## operator
Allows for the customization of how an object of a given class can be modified and interacted with
```
class foo {
  // deletes the parentheses assignment operator for the class
  operator() = delete;
};
```
<!-- TODO: Add a move semantics section that allows pairs with the operator keyword
